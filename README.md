## How to use  ?

For the regular user, you can [add the bot to your server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=748846588163784794&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=478208).

### I want to host the bot

You are allowed to host the bot and make changes, but you need to respect the license : You can't use the bot as a commercial purpose (you can't make money using the bot).

To host the bot, you can download all the files, run `npm install` and then rename .env.example to .env and customise it.

You can then run the bot with `node index.js` and (optionally) the webserver with `node web.js`.
