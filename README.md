# Copyright & Credits

This bot originally written by and full credits to [Harfeur](https://github.com/Harfeur/TwitchAlerts) under the MIT License.

This forked repository is in place for me to tweak and upgrade functionality to suit my needs, while maintaining the ability to contribute these upstream.

Harfeur hosts a public instance of the original bot, you can add that to your server via the link above.

If you find any issues, you can report it here https://github.com/iamdadmin/TwitchAlerts/issues if it is strictly related to my customisations, otherwise you should use https://github.com/Harfeur/TwitchAlerts/issues.

## How to use  ?

### Host your own bot using node directly

You are allowed to host the bot and make changes, but you need to respect the license : You can't use the bot as a commercial purpose (you can't make money using the bot).

To host the bot, you can download all the files, run `npm install` and then rename .env.example to .env and customise it.

You can then run the bot with `npm run start` and (optionally) the webserver with `npm run web`.

### Host your own bot using Docker

Optionally, you can utilise the docker-compose example to run this under docker. See the z_docker folder for more information.
